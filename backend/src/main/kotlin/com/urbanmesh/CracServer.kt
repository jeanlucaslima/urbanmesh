/**
 * CRaC [Resource] that manages the CIO engine lifecycle across checkpoint/restore.
 *
 * **Before checkpoint**: stops the CIO engine (unbinds port, cancels accept loop)
 * while keeping the fully-configured [io.ktor.server.application.Application] alive
 * in the heap — all Ktor plugins and routes remain installed.
 *
 * **After restore**: creates a fresh [CIOApplicationEngine] via [CIO.create] that
 * reuses the existing Application. Only port binding happens;
 * [configureApplication] does NOT run again.
 *
 * @param server The [EmbeddedServer] created and started before checkpoint.
 * @param port   The port to bind on after restore.
 * @param host   The host to bind on after restore.
