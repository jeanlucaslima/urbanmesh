/**
 * A TenantCodeInjector that delegates to a swappable underlying injector.
 *
 * Used for CRaC support: the Viaduct factory is created with this injector
 * before Koin is initialized (to capture expensive schema compilation in the
 * checkpoint). After restore, the delegate is set to a real KoinTenantCodeInjector
 * backed by a Koin instance with live environment configuration.
 *
 * The providers returned by [getProvider] resolve lazily through the delegate,
 * so they are safe to construct before the delegate is set — as long as
 * [Provider.get] is not called until after wiring.
